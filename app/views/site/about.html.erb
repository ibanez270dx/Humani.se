<h1>Hi. I'm a Software Engineer.</h1>
<article>
  <p>
    My name is Jeff Miller and I enjoy creating software. In particular, I enjoy
    exploring the ever advancing & challanging world of web and mobile
    application development. I am currently a Senior Full Stack Engineer over at
    <%= link_to 'Cognoa', 'http://www.cognoa.com', target: '_blank' %>,
    whose mission is to employ big data and machine learning to vastly improve
    early childhood detection of developmental disabilities, including autism.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've set up this website/testbed to share some of my projects, experiences,
    and thoughts about what I've learned over the years working and living in
    the heart of Silicon Valley. Outside work, I enjoy refining my skills at
    Hackathons, Meetups, and being an advocate for STEM Education. Having conducted
    multiple university technical workshops, I constantly try to engage those around me
    in the immensely creative, captivating, and deeply satisfying nature of programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    My hope is that something I share here can help you get inspired, solve something, or
    at least provide some insight about programming or whatever else I decide to write about.
